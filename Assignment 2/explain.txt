fwrite works on streams (buffered) and write runs a system call for each buffer.
System calls are very costly compared to fwrite which consolidates all the calls into a singular write command once
the buffer is filled out or the system is closed.

fwrite will be faster in small byte amounts, while for large byte amounts, write will be faster.
